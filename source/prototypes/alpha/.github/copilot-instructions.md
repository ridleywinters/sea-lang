# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This is the **alpha** prototype for the Sea programming language compiler.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Avoid comments that state the obvious. Only add comments that explain architectural decisions, non-trivial algorithms, performance trade-offs, or non-obvious aspects of the code.
- Prefer "early return" patterns to reduce nesting and improve readability.

## Rust-specific Code Style Guidelines

- Avoid defining functions in `mod.rs`. Put implementations in their own files named after the functionality they provide.
